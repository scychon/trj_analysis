program read_xtc_prog
 
    ! 1. Use the xdr interface
    use xtc, only: xtcfile
 
    implicit none
 
    ! 2. Declare a variable of type xtcfile
    type(xtcfile) :: xtc
 
    ! 3. Initialize it with the name of xtc file you want to read in.
    call xtc % init("traj.xtc")
 
    ! 4. Read in each configuration. Everything is stored in the xtcfile
    ! type (precision, time,
    !    step, no of atoms, positions, etc.). Look in the xtc module for
    !    more details.
    !    You can save the positions in the loop for your calculations in
    !    another array, or 
    !    do your calculations after each read.
 
    call xtc % read
 
    do while ( xtc % STAT == 0 )
 
        ! Just an example to show what was read in
        write(*,'(a,f12.6,a,i0)') " Time (ps): ", xtc % time, "  Step: ", xtc % STEP
        write(*,'(a,f12.6,a,i0)') " Precision: ", xtc % prec, "  No. Atoms: ", xtc % NATOMS
        write(*,'(3f9.3)') xtc % pos
 
        ! This is the same order as found in the GRO format fyi
        write(*,'(11f9.5)') xtc % box(1,1), xtc % box(2,2), xtc % box(3,3), &
                            xtc % box(1,2), xtc % box(1,3), & 
                            xtc % box(2,1), xtc % box(2,3), &
                            xtc % box(3,1), xtc % box(3,2) 
        call xtc % read
 
    end do
 
    ! 5. Close the file
    call xtc % close
 
end program read_xtc_prog
